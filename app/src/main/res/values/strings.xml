    <string name="description_index_of_refraction">Index of refraction, "In optics, the refractive index or index of
        refraction of a material is a dimensionless number that describes how light
        propagates through that medium. It is defined as n = c / v, where c is the speed
        of light in vacuum and v is the phase velocity of light in the medium.
        For example, the refractive index of water is 1.333, meaning that light
        travels 1.333 times faster in a vacuum than it does in water. © Wikipedia</string>

    <string name="description_cylinder_power">Cylindrical correction corrects astigmatic refractive
        error of the eye by adding or subtracting power cylindrically in a meridian

    <string name="description_axis">Axis is present only if there is a value for cylinder. This indicates
        the angle in degrees of one of two major meridians the prescribed
        cylindrical power is in. Which major meridian is referenced is indicated by
        the cylindrical correction being in plus or minus notation</string>
    <string name="description_real_base_curve">The base curve (usually determined from the profile
        of the front surface of an ophthalmic lens) can be changed to result in the
        best optic and cosmetic characteristics across the entire surface of the lens.
        Optometrists may choose to specify a particular base curve when prescribing a
        corrective lens for either of these reasons. A multitude of mathematical formulas
        and professional clinical experience has allowed optometrists and lens designers
        to determine standard base curves that are ideal for most people. As a result,
        the front surface curve is more standardized and the characteristics that
        generate a person\'s unique prescription are typically derived from the geometry
        of the back surface of the lens</string>

    <string name="description_transposition">Ophthalmologists and a few older optometrists (different types of eye doctors),
        write astigmatism prescriptions with positive «+» cylinders. This is because many years ago the instruments used
        to measure and cut lenses were only able to do so in positive increments.
        Nowadays the majority of labs cut lenses in the negative «-», and require that any positive
        «+» cylinder prescriptions be converted into the negative «-» equivalent.
