It is defined as n = c \/ v, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and v is the phase velocity of light in the medium.\\n\\tFor example, the refractive index of water is 1.333, meaning that light travels 1.333 times faster in a vacuum than it does in water ©Wikipedia"

Optometrists may choose to specify a particular base curve when prescribing a corrective lens for either of these reasons. A multitude of mathematical formulas and professional clinical experience has allowed optometrists and lens designers to determine standard base curves that are ideal for most people. As a result, the front surface curve is more standardized and the characteristics that generate a person\"s unique prescription are typically derived from the geometry of the back surface of the lens"
